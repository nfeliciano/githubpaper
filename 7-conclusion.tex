In this work, we conducted a case study to investigate student perceptions of using GitHub in an educational context. From our findings, we uncovered ways in which GitHub benefitted students in the project-based courses we investigated, as well as discovered what students struggled with. More importantly, however, we extracted some ways in which GitHub has the potential to support their learning, even further than what they experienced in these two courses. Beyond the exposure to a popular industry tool, GitHub simplifies the process in which students can participate in a number of activities, such as reviewing each other's work, contributing work or helpful comments to each other, and making changes or suggestions to course materials.

An important consideration from this work relates to the future of tools for computer science and software engineering education: what's next? First, we consider the importance of participation, group work, and group learning for students in technical fields in order to develop non-technical `soft' skills such as communication and teamwork \cite{jazayeri2004education}. This work demonstrates how using GitHub can unlock activities where students can contribute to each other's learning, and as a result, we believe it can be beneficial to add support for the open, collaborative workflow GitHub encourages to current and future tools focused on learning.

%GitHub for Education
% The fact that GitHub easily supports participatory activities has multiple implications. Literature has shown that LMSes have been adding `Web 2.0' features such as blogs and wikis to their feature set \cite{downes2005feature}---students are being offered more opportunities to participate by discussion or by contributing content in blogs or wikis. Where the GitHub Way excels in education, however, is in the opportunities for students to contribute to and change the materials, and to contribute to each other's learning by getting involved in and providing feedback to projects other than their own. This is potentially the next step for Learning Management Systems, where students are more easily able to make these contributions to the work of others. The concern, however, is that implementing features similar to GitHub in an LMS might seem forced and haphazardly planned, and tool builders would be better served building a tool that supports and encourages an open, collaborative workflow from the outset.

As such, one possible path is the `GitHub for Education' Greg Wilson discussed\footnote{\url{http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2011/12/fork-merge-and-share.html}}, where a tool like GitHub can be altered or built to be more focused towards education. The main weakness of GitHub when used in this context is in the lack of flexibility in its privacy and in the lack of administrative functions such as gradebooks and announcements. Meanwhile, there are open-source alternatives to GitHub, such as GitLab\footnote{\url{https://about.gitlab.com}}, that could be further developed into a tool that fulfils more educational needs. As an example, it could be valuable to implement a form of announcements, a notification feature that students have more control over, and a way to make some discussions or files within a repository private while others remain public. This a potential avenue for future work, where such a tool can be evaluated.

This work is just the beginning of learning more about how GitHub can benefit students and educators, what challenges people face when GitHub is used for this purpose, and how these challenges might be addressed. Possible directions for future research include investigating the effectiveness of GitHub's open workflow in large-scale courses and a deeper investigation on whether GitHub can properly support education outside of the software engineering domain.

% As well, because of the exploratory nature of the work, we sought to obtain teacher and student perspectives regarding just the viability of GitHub as a tool for education. However, other studies have investigated using tools such as wikis \cite{minocha2007collaborative} and how they possibly affect or correlate with student performance. This is one natural extension of this work: running a field experiment to see whether or not using the tool simply engages the students more or if it can ultimately affect grades.
