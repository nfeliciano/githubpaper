% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.0 May 2012
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

\title{Student Experiences Using GitHub in Software Engineering Courses: A Case Study}

%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{1} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\begin{abstract}
GitHub has been embraced by the software development community as an important social platform for managing software projects and to support collaborative development. More recently, educators have begun to adopt it for hosting course content and student assignments. From our previous research, we found that educators leverage GitHub's collaboration and transparency features to create, reuse and remix course materials, and to encourage student contributions and monitor student activity on assignments and projects. However, our previous research did not consider the student perspective.

In this paper, we present a case study where GitHub is used as a learning platform for two software engineering courses. We gathered student perspectives on how the use of GitHub in their courses might benefit them and to identify the challenges they may face. The findings from our case study indicate that software engineering students do benefit from GitHub's transparent and open workflow. However, students were concerned that since GitHub is not inherently an educational tool, it lacks key features important for education and poses learning and privacy concerns. Our findings provide recommendations for designers on how tools such as GitHub can be used to improve software engineering education, and also point to recommendations for instructors on how to use it more effectively in their courses.

% Peggy: making the abstract shorter...
%Moreover, we highlight the importance of educating both students and instructors about GitHub's features and workflow, tcreate an environment that maximizes its benefits in software engineering education. We are just at the start of this adoption curve, so it is important to understand the opportunities and risks using GitHub may introduce to the teaching of software engineering and computer science.
