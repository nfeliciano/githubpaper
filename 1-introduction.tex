The use of version control systems has become increasingly commonplace in software development. Distributed version control systems (DVCS) in particular are typically used in collaboration and to interact with the global software development community. As such, using DVCS has become an essential skill for software engineers. However, the integration of DVCS into computing education as a way of teaching students these skills has so far gained little attention. In this study, we discover the implications of using a distributed version control system as a course platform.

%not just focused on this, but has been highlighted as important
Computer science and software engineering education has increasingly focused on the development of not just technical skills, but also soft skills such as communication and teamwork \cite{jazayeri2004education}. One such way to develop these skills is to allow students to contribute to each other's learning experiences and to course materials \cite{falkner2012supporting}. This concept, called `Contributing Student Pedagogy' \cite{hamer2008contributing}, relies highly on the technology surrounding the learning experience: the e-learning tool utilized to facilitate interactions between course participants and the learning materials.

GitHub is a social code sharing service and version control system. It is a popular tool for many groups and projects that require collaboration, and has even seen utilization in areas outside software development, such as technical writing \footnote{\url{http://readwrite.com/2013/11/08/seven-ways-to-use-github-that-arent-coding}}. The advantages of GitHub and similar tools include their awareness and transparency features, where collaborators can easily stay informed of others' work \cite{dabbish2012social}. As well, collaborators in a GitHub repository can be involved in a project in a number of ways, such as contributing to discussions regarding bugs and features, or making changes to a project itself and allowing other collaborators to review and accept their changes. This open, collaborative workflow is called `The GitHub Way'\footnote{\url{http://www.wired.com/2013/09/github-for-anything/}} as these features are not necessarily exclusive to GitHub and can be found in other Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSes) such as BitBucket. In a previous study \cite{Zagalsky}, we interviewed instructors who were early adopters of using GitHub as a learning platform and extracted their motivations and what benefits and challenges they encountered. It is also important, however, to explore the student perspective and to discern how the use of GitHub as an educational tool might affect students.

This work presents a case study whereupon GitHub was used as an e-learning tool for project-based, university courses, particularly focusing on the collaborative and contributive activities GitHub could enable students to partake in. The work is largely exploratory in order to discern how GitHub can impact learning, including the potential benefits and possible challenges students meet or expect to meet with GitHub's use in this context. While the instructors and students reaped many benefits from using GitHub in these courses, there were drawbacks and challenges with using a tool not built for education. Conclusions from this work can determine the viability of GitHub as an educational tool, or can help shape the development of future educationally-focused tools which, similar to GitHub, gives students the opportunity to contribute to the learning experience in multiple ways. To do so, we interviewed the course participants (the students and the teaching team) regarding their experiences with using GitHub in their course to gather their perspectives on whether or not the GitHub workflow can support computer science courses.

Our main contributions include the evaluation of using a DVCS such as GitHub for computing courses from the point of view of both students and the teaching team. As well, we extract suggestions for ways to use GitHub as a learning platform to maximize the benefits of its use in an educational context.

% \subsection{Research Questions}
% This study aims to explore the use of a tool such as GitHub and its effectiveness in the educational context. These research questions are exploratory in nature:
%
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item \textbf{What are computer science and software engineering student perceptions on the benefits of using GitHub for their courses?}
% \item \textbf{What challenges will students face related to the use of GitHub in their courses?}
% \item \textbf{What are student recommendations for instructors wishing to use GitHub in a course?}
% \end{enumerate}

%rqs

We conducted interviews with the students and the teaching team involved in the courses selected for these cases and followed up with a survey to validate our findings. Our findings indicate that students find that GitHub allows them to partake in activities not typically available in their typical courses, such as being able to easily contribute to each other's work in various ways. However, students expressed concerns regarding the public nature in which their work was hosted on GitHub for this case study.


%This allows for an approach to learning characterized by a \emph{demand-pull} model rather than a \emph{supply-push} model, and focuses on participation and providing students access to rich learning communities \cite{seely2008open}
